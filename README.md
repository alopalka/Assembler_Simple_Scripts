# Assembler_Simple_Scripts

### What is this project?

This project is contains 4 simple assembler x86 scripts. They are to short to divide them on seperate repos. More like fun fact rather then something serious.

### INFO

To compile it i used command "NASM.EXE -o OUTPUT.COM SCRIPT.ASM"

## Script - 1 - "Print in the centre"

Insert text. To confirm press enter. Text is printed in the middle of the screen. In the end cursor gets back to the position where it came from.


## Script - 2 - "Lowercase"

Script prints instantly key that you press. But if it is uppercased letter script changes it to lowercase. That's all

## Script - 3 - "Draw #"

Insert number from range 10-99. Script will print that many "#" as the user entered.
